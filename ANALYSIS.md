1. What is the exact cause of ConcurrentModificationException in Java?

Ans: ConcurrentModificationException occurs when a collection is structurally modified while it is being iterated using an Iterator, enhanced for-loop, or stream, without using the iterator's own modification methods.

For Example:
- Adding/removing elements from an ArrayList inside a for-each loop
- One thread modifying a collection while another thread is iterating it ---this may be the possible reason.The log says [http-nio-8080-exec-23] — this is a Tomcat worker thread. At peak load, multiple threads are processing statements simultaneously, likely sharing the same list instance.


2. What code pattern at line 142 most likely triggered this error?

Ans : Most likely pattern:

The collection was probably modified during iteration.

// Line ~142 — likely pattern in filterTransactions()
for (Transaction tx : transactions) {       // iterator created here
    if (tx.getAmount() < threshold) {
        transactions.remove(tx);            // line 142 — modCount incremented
    }                                       // next loop → checkForComodification()
}

 
The for-each loop internally uses ArrayList$Itr. When transactions.remove(tx) is called directly on the list (not through the iterator), modCount changes but expectedModCount does not — the very next call to iterator.next() at the top of the loop detects the mismatch and throws.

3. Provide the minimal code change (one or two lines) that resolves this safely.

Ans: We need to use Iterator.remove() instead of modifying the collection directly.

		
	// FIX: Using explicit iterator.remove() to avoid ConcurrentModificationException
Iterator<Transaction> iterator = transactions.iterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    if (iterator.next().getAmount() < threshold) {
        iterator.remove();  // avoids ConcurrentModificationException
    }
}
